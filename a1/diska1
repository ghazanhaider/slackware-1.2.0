etc:      have been moved out of the /etc directory and into the /sbin

idekern:  Linux kernel version 1.0.8, without SCSI support.
idekern:  
idekern:  A Linux kernel for computers that do not need SCSI support. You MUST
idekern:  install either package "idekern", or package "scsikern" if you need
idekern:  SCSI support. If you fail to install either one of them, your system
idekern:  will not work. If you're not sure which package (idekern/scsikern) to
idekern:  install, you should probably use scsikern, since it supports the most
idekern:  hardware. If you don't have SCSI, the advantage of using the idekern
idekern:  kernel is mainly that your machine will boot faster. See the file
idekern:  'idekern.log' for an exact list of included drivers.

passwd:   Password utilities, and account maintenance programs.
passwd: 
passwd:   These utilities do not support shadow passwords, but seem more stable
passwd:   and secure than the versions that do. Mostly because of problems with
passwd:   the shadow versions of some of the networking utilities, and because
passwd:   most users have no need for shadow passwords anyway, Slackware has 
passwd:   decided to follow MCC's lead and go with a non-shadow password 
passwd:   system by default. 
scsikern: Linux kernel version 1.0.8, with SCSI + IDE support. 
scsikern:
scsikern: This is a Linux kernel with full support for SCSI devices such as hard
scsikern: drives, tape drives, and CD-ROM drives. If you have not already
scsikern: installed the "idekern" kernel with IDE support only, then you must
scsikern: install this package or your system will not boot. If you need this
scsikern: kernel but have already installed "idekern", just go ahead and install
scsikern: this package to replace the IDE kernel with a SCSI one. See the file
scsikern: 'scsikern.log' for an exact list of included drivers.

sysvinit: SysV style init v. 2.4
sysvinit:
sysvinit: System V style init programs by Miquel van Smoorenburg that control
sysvinit: the booting and shutdown of your system. These support a number of
sysvinit: system runlevels, each with a specific set of utilities spawned. For
sysvinit: example, the normal system runlevel is 5, which starts getty on 
sysvinit: virtual consoles tty1 - tty6. Runlevel 6 starts xdm. Runlevel 0 shuts
sysvinit: the system down. See the documentation in /usr/doc/SysVinit-2.4 and
sysvinit: the scripts in /etc/rc.d for more information.

hdsetup:  The full screen and tty versions of setup and pkgtool, two utilities
hdsetup:  included with Slackware that allow you to easily install software 
hdsetup:  packages, remove software packages, and review the installed software
hdsetup:  packages.
