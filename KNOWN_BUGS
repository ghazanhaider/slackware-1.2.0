Support for xiafs was inadvertantly left out of most of the kernels in the
1.2.0 release. Best to stick with ext2 until I can get this fixed (actually,
best to stick to ext2, period ;^).

It may be a while until I can recompile all those kernels.

-----------------

GNU su was made to work by adding:

   pw = getpwnam (new_user);

at line 285 of su.c in shellutils-1.9.4.

Thanks to Jeff Jennings for providing a fix.
