This is Slackware Linux 1.2.0.

This version contains libc 4.5.24, Linux kernel 1.0, and gcc 2.5.8. 
I'm still behind in my mail, but feel free to report any problems you
find. I can't promise a response but I *do* appreciate the help people 
offer me in fixing problems.

This is what you'll find in the subdirectories below:

./install       Boot/install disks for 1.44M and 1.2M floppy drives. You will 
                need at least one boot disk and one rootdisk to install this
                software. See the README file in ./install for more 
                information.

./a1 - ./a3     The base system. Enough to get up and running and have elvis
                and comm programs available. Based around the 1.0 Linux
                kernel, and concepts from the new filesystem standard (FSSTND). 
                
                These disks are known to fit on 1.2M disks, although the rest 
                of Slackware won't. If you have only a 1.2M floppy, you can 
                still install the base system, download other disks you want 
                and install them from your hard drive. 

./ap1 - ./ap4   Various applications and add ons, such as the manual pages,
                groff, ispell (GNU and international versions), term, joe,
                jove, ghostscript, sc, bc, ftape support, and the quota patches.

./d1 - ./d6     Program development. GCC/G++/Objective C 2.5.8, make (GNU and
                BSD), byacc and GNU bison, flex, the 4.5.24 C libraries, gdb,
                kernel source for Linux 1.0, SVGAlib, ncurses, clisp, f2c, p2c,
                m4, perl, rcs.

./e1 - ./e5     GNU Emacs 19.22.

./f1            A collection of FAQs and other documentation.

./i1 - ./i3     Info pages for GNU software, readable by 'info' or Emacs.

./n1 - ./n3     Networking. TCP/IP, UUCP, mailx, dip, deliver, elm, pine, 
                smail, cnews, nn, tin, trn, inn.

./oop1          Object Oriented Programming. GNU Smalltalk 1.1.1, and the
                Smalltalk Interface to X. (STIX)

./q1            Although this series is gone now, it may resurface as a place
                to find kernel images with extra drivers, and possibly kernel
		source patches, so I've left the option for it on the install
		menu.

./tcl1 - ./tcl2 Tcl, Tk, TclX, blt, itcl. 

./u1 - ./u2     Optional disks supporting the UMSDOS filesystem. These disks 
                should only be installed when using UMSDOS for your root
		filesystem. For those who aren't familiar with it, UMSDOS is
		a filesystem which runs on top of an MS-DOS filesystem and 
		allows long filenames, hard and symbolic links, and the other
		features needed to support Linux. Although not as fast as a
		native Linux filesystem, it's great for trying out Linux, and
		not bad on a system with a smaller hard drive that must also 
		run DOS.

./y1            Games. The BSD games collection, and Tetris for terminals.

--------- X windows disks:

./x1 - ./x8     The base XFree86 2.1 system, with libXpm, fvwm 1.21c, and xlock
                added.

./xap1 - ./xap2 X applications: X11 ghostscript, libgr13, seyon, workman, 
                xfilemanager, xv 3.00, GNU chess and xboard, xfm 1.2, 
                xgrabsc, ghostview, and various X games.

./xd1 - ./xd2   X11 server linkkit, PEX support, and X11 programming man pages.

./xv1 - ./xv2   Xview 3.2 release 5. XView libraries, and the Open Look 
                virtual and non-virtual window managers.

./iv1 - ./iv4   InterViews libraries, include files, 'doc', 'idraw', and other
                applications and utilities from the InterViews 3.1
		distribution.

./oi1 - ./oi3   ParcPlace's Object Builder 2.0 and Object Interface Library
                4.0, generously made available for Linux developers according
                to the terms in the "copying" notice found in these
                directories. 
		NOTE: These haven't worked since we stopped using libc.so.4.4.4,
		so they've been placed in the /pub/linux/old/oi directory.

./t1 - ./t5     TeX support. This is the LaTeX2e release ported by W. Woody Jin.


Enjoy!
