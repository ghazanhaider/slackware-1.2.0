Instructions for installing Slackware on machines with a 5.25" boot drive
and a 3.5" second floppy drive.
---------------

5.25" boot drives have been well supported since version 1.1.1.  It is possible
to install on a machine that has only a 5.25" drive. Note however, that this
doesn't mean it will be as easy as installing from 3.5", but if you install off
of your hard drive it may actually be easier.

The first 3 disks of Slackware Linux, the A disks, should all fit within
1.2M. To install them, you'll need a boot kernel, and a rootdisk. These can
be found under bootdisk/1_2meg. Read the README file in the bootdisk 
directory, it gives more information about the new bootdisks.

To make the boot kernel disk, copy the boot kernel of your choice to a floppy
using dd or RAWWRITE.EXE.

To make the root disk, write color12 or tty12 to a floppy in the same way.

Use the boot kernel disk to boot the rootdisk (color12 or tty12), and install
from there. This will load the ramdisk. Once you have the "darkstar:" prompt
you may remove the disk from your machine and continue with the installation.

Once you've got the base system installed, you can install the rest of the
disks by downloaded them on to your harddrive and installing them from there.
Disk series other than A won't wit onto 1.2M disks.

I sincerely hope this helps!
