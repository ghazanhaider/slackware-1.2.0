itcl:     [incr Tcl] - version 1.3
itcl: 
itcl:     [incr Tcl] adds object-oriented programming facilities to Tcl.  It
itcl:     was NOT designed as yet another whiz-bang object-oriented programming
itcl:     language; indeed, it is patterned somewhat after C++.  It was designed
itcl:     to support more structured programming in Tcl.  Scripts that grow
itcl:     beyond a few thousand lines become extremely difficult to maintain.
itcl:     [incr Tcl] attacks this problem in the same way that any object-
itcl:     oriented programming language would, by providing mechanisms for
itcl:     data encapsulation behind well-defined interfaces.

tclx:     TclX - Extended Tcl: Extended command set for Tcl (v. 7.3a)
tclx:
tclx:     Extended Tcl is a superset of standard Tcl and is built alongside the
tclx:     standard Tcl sources. Extended Tcl has three basic functional areas: 
tclx:     A set of new commands, a Tcl shell (i.e. a Unix shell-style command 
tclx:     line and interactive environment), and a user-extensible library of
tclx:     useful Tcl procedures, any of which can be automatically loaded on the
tclx:     first attempt to execute it.
