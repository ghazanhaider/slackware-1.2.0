ghostscr: GNU Ghostscript version 2.6.1 - (with fixes 01-04 applied).
ghostscr: Preview, print and process PostScript documents on both PostScript and
ghostscr: non-PostScript devices. This version supports all SVGAlib video modes
ghostscr: for output directly to the screen. See the man page for "gs" for more
ghostscr: information. [NOTE]: The /usr/bin/gs binary included with this package
ghostscr: does not support X11; support was left out so that Slackware users 
ghostscr: without X could use SVGAlib output and not need to install the X 
ghostscr: shared libraries. If you need X11 support, you should also install the
ghostscr: package "gs_x11" found on the XAP series. It contains a /usr/bin/gs
ghostscr: with support for X11 (as well as full SVGAlib support).
