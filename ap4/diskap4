vim:      completion, block operations, etc.

mt_st:    mt-st-0.1 - controls magnetic tape drive operation
mt_st:
mt_st:    This mt originates from BSD NET-2. Some Linux SCSI tape-specific
mt_st:    ioctls have been added to the original source and the man page has
mt_st:    been updated. Although this mt program is tailored for SCSI tape, it
mt_st:    can also be used with the QIC-02 driver and hopefully with other Linux
mt_st:    tape drivers using the same ioctls (some of the commands may not work
mt_st:    with all drivers).

gp9600:   This is a script that allows you to set your modem speed. If you do
gp9600:   not install this script, your baud rate will be set to 9600. If you
gp9600:   install it, a menu will be presented later on allowing you to select
gp9600:   any of the following baud rates:
gp9600:
gp9600:   300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400.
gp9600:
gp9600:   If you need something faster than this, you should set the baud to
gp9600:   38400, which can be changed to mean a faster rate with setserial.

groff:    GNU troff 1.09 document formatting system.
groff:
groff:    The groff package provides versions of troff, nroff, eqn, tbl, and 
groff:    other Unix text-formatting utilities. Groff is used to "compile" man
groff:    pages stored in groff/nroff format into a form which can be printed or
groff:    displayed on the screen. These man pages would be in /usr/man/man?. 
groff:    Most of the man pages in the Slackware Linux distribution (except in
groff:    the groff package) have been preformatted, GNU zipped, and placed in 
groff:    the /usr/man/preformat/cat? directories. Groff is not needed to view
groff:    preformatted man pages.
