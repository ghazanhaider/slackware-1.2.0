gs_x11:   This should be installed on top of the "ghostscr" package from the
gs_x11:   A series to provide X11 support for ghostview. If you plan to preview
gs_x11:   Postscript documents under X, you need to install this. Also, if 
gs_x11:   you've installed ghostscript already it is highly recommended that you
gs_x11:   install this package just in case. Since it replaces another binary
gs_x11:   it really only uses about 25K.
