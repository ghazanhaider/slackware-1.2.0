I've got a friend that needed libc-4.4.4 to compile a MUD, and occasionally
I see people on the net who want to run the old libc-4.4.4 and GCC 2.4.5, so
I've put this package together to allow people running Slackware 1.1.2 or
higher to downgrade their compilers and C libraries to version 4.4.4.

This package is really easy to install, but it *must* be installed from a
boot/rootdisk, using setup or pkgtool. You won't get far if you try to install
it from your hard drive - the first thing it does is remove the C libraries 
and compilers, including libc.so.4.*.*.

There are 2 series for this. The second series is the optional 
profiling/debugging libs and GNU Objective-C 2.4.5.

ZDN series (2 disks):
  -- removes any 4.5.x C libraries, shared and development, and the GNU 2.5.x
     C/C++/ObjC compilers.
  -- adds the 4.4.4 C libraries and GNU C/C++ 2.4.5.
  -- patches ld.so to prevent annoying warnings about possible library 
     mismatches. If you find that new binaries no longer work under
     libc-4.4.4, recompile them. Most will work fine, but C++ apps will
     likely need to be recompiled.

ZZX series (1 disk):
  -- Adds debugging/profiling libs v. 4.4.4
  -- Optional GNU Objective-C compiler 2.4.5.

I haven't tried this stuff on a networked machine, but it seems to work.
It's a mixed bag, though - I found when testing it that some new programs
won't compile because they need header files that weren't present in the
4.4.4 version. On the other hand, OI is likely to work a lot better with
these libraries.

I like the new 4.5.x libraries and GCC 2.5.x better myself, and plan to
continue using those, but I like to give everyone as many options as
possible.  Isn't that kind of flexibility what Linux is all about?

Source for GCC 2.4.5 and libc 4.4.4 can still be found on ftp.cdrom.com,
in /pub/linux/slackware_source/d/gcc, and /pub/linux/slackware_source/d/libc.
