ldso:     ldso-1.4.3 (hacked for library downgrade)
ldso:
ldso:     A specially hacked version of ld.so-1.4.3 that will not complain
ldso:     about potentially incompatible shared libraries. If you find that
ldso:     new binaries no longer work under libc-4.4.4, recompile them. Most
ldso:     will work fine, but C++ apps will likely need to be recompiled.
