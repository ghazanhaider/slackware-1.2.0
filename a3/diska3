keytbls:  kbd 0.85
keytbls:
keytbls:  Load and save keyboard mappings. Needed if you are not using the US
keytbls:  keyboard map. This package also contains utilities to change your
keytbls:  console fonts, although you will need to patch the kernel to be able
keytbls:  to use them. The functionality is similar to the 'national' package
keytbls:  that used to be available.

lpr:      BSD print spooling system.                           
lpr:
lpr:      NOTE: The lpd binary included in this package expects to find
lpr:      TCP/IP running if TCP/IP support is found in the Linux kernel. If
lpr:      you do not plan to install the TCP/IP package, then you will have 
lpr:      to recompile your kernel removing TCP/IP support. If you do not, 
lpr:      lpd will die immediately after it is started.

select:   Selection 1.5
select:
select:   This adds two programs to /usr/bin : selection and test-mouse. Start
select:   selection as a background process and the mouse may be used to cut 
select:   and paste text from the screen. 
select:  
select:   NOTE: This program may cause problems when you start X on systems 
select:   that do not use a serial mouse. If you get an 'unable to open mouse 
select:   device' error from X, this program should be your prime suspect.
