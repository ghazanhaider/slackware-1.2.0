INSTALLATION DISKS DIRECTORY

This is the directory under which can be found the disks needed to install
Slackware Linux 1.2.0. You will need at least one bootkernel disk, and one
root-install disk. Look in the subdirectory that corresponds with the size
of your boot media (1.2 meg or 1.44 meg). The README files in the "bootdisks" 
and "rootdisks" sub-directories will give you more detailed information to help
you choose which disks are best suited to your hardware.

Good luck!
