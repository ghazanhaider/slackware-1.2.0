These are the 1.2 MB root-install disks for Slackware 1.2.0.

You will need one of these disks to install Linux. The disk is created by 
uncompressing the image with GZIP.EXE. (Example: GZIP -d colrlite.gz), and
then writing the image out with RAWRITE.EXE. RAWRITE is interactive and 
reasonably user-friendly.

Here's a description of the choices:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

colrlite.gz: A root-install disk for 1.2 MB floppy drives. This disk uses the
new full-screen color install program. NOTE: This version of the install system
is still undergoing testing. It is, in particular, not forgiving of extra
keystrokes entered between screens. Keytable support did not fit on this disk,
so use tty12.gz if you need to load a different keytable for use during the
installation process.

tty12.gz: A complete tty-based root-install disk for 1.2 MB floppy drives. 
Contains a rewritten version of the installation scripts used for Slackware
1.1.1. Includes keytable support.
