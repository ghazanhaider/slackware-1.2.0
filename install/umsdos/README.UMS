This is an EXPERIMENTAL version of the Slackware Linux distribution made to
be installed onto existing DOS partitions without the need for repartitioning
or reformatting. The system will be installed into a \linux directory on one
of your DOS partitions, and will be bootable through the use of a boot disk.
Don't create a \linux directory on your dos drive prior to installing.

You will need 8 megabytes minimum to avoid having to create a swap partition.

You also need a 1.44 meg floppy drive. It can be either your first or second
floppy drive. If you have a 1.44MB boot drive, you'll need to use the 
boot144 disk to boot the root144 disk. If you have a 1.2MB boot drive,
then get the boot12 disk and use it to boot the root144 disk in your
second floppy drive. These disks must be ungzipped and written to formatted
floppies with RAWRITE.EXE, dd, or cat. GZIP.EXE can be found up one directory
level, and RAWRITE.EXE can be found up two levels.

You MUST also make the U1 and U2 disks, and install them along with at least
the normal Slackware A series. These are in the /u1 and /u2 directories two
levels above this one. Like with the other package disks, just copy the files
onto MS-DOS formatted disks.

I tried installing the A series and U series (but not kernel source) and found
it took slightly less than 12 megabytes. So, to give Linux a test drive, that's
the smallest space you can squeeze a minimal system into.

I'll take any bug reports or comments you have on this. I get *tons* of mail,
so if I don't answer yours, don't take it personally. :^) I wish I could
answer it all.

Good luck, and have fun trying this out!
