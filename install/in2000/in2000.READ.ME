These are bootkernels that contain the alpha in2000 SCSI driver. Once you've 
installed, you'll have to do one of these things:

1. Use the bootkernel to boot your system (mount root=/dev/sda1, or whatever)

2. Steal the kernel off the bootkernel disk and use it on your own system.
   You can do this by mounting it (mount /dev/fd0 /mnt) and then copying the
   kernel image over your own. You'll want to make it mount your root partition
   as read-only (rdev -R /vmlinuz 1), and then reinstall lilo if you're using
   that, or make a new bootdisk if you're not. If you're not sure how to do 
   this, just start 'setup' on your system and choose the menu option to 
   reconfigure your machine.

3. The best (but trickest) option is to compile a custom kernel for your
   machine. Apply the patches in the in2000.tar.gz file to your kernel source,
   rebuild the kernel and install it.

There are two bootkernels in this directory, one for 3.5" 1.44 MB floppy
drives (in2K_144.gz) and one for 5.25" 1.2 MB floppy drives (in2K_12.gz).
These need to be decompressed with gzip before you write them out to floppy.
See the instructions in the above directory.

Good luck! :^)
