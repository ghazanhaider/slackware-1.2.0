These are root-install disks for Slackware 1.2.0.

You will need one of these disks to install Linux. The disk is created by 
uncompressing the image with GZIP.EXE. (Example: GZIP -d color144.gz), and
then writing the image out with RAWRITE.EXE. RAWRITE is interactive and 
reasonably user-friendly.

Here's a description of the choices:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.44 MB drives:

color144.gz: A root-install disk for 1.44 MB floppy drives. This disk uses the
new full-screen color install program. NOTE: This version of the install system
is still undergoing testing. It is, in particular, not forgiving of extra
keystrokes entered between screens. It is nice to look at, though. :^)

tty144.gz: A root-install disk for 1.44 MB floppy drives. This contains new 
versions of the tty-based install scripts from Slackware 1.1.1. All the new
keymaps should be supported.
